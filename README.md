#How to use this repository

## This repository includes two sets of instructions on how to create an image-sharing web application. 

## For new developers
** Since you may want a more transparent understanding of how to construct all pages of the application, please start with these instructions. Find them inside the folders marked **Day 1 - Day 4**.

**Day 1** and **Day 2** are a tutorial on HTML and JavaScript and how to build the page to run locally without being able to save the finished filtered image. You may want to jump ahead to **Day 3** and **Day 4** to begin creating the actual application immediately from start to finish.

You might find it helpful to first read through this ([overview](docs/Tasks.md)) which describes the specs for this web app, and the logistical issues and tasks that are involved with creating it. 

**About the files**: All the individual files not inside the folders in this repository are the files necessary for this web application to run. You could in theory save all these files to a directory on your server, and with a few tweaks for database names, file names, etc., get it all to work. But we are going to build these pages from scratch using the instructions in folders Day 3 - Day 4 so you can understand the development process better.

## For more experienced developers 
** ([These instructions](z-oldResources/README-WordpressEdition.md)) include how to send the rendered images to a WordPress gallery which provides the opportunity to extend the gallery features even further to include comments, user login, and more.
