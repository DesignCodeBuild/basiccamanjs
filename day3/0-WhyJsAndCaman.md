# Why Do We Use Javascript and Caman?

## Javascript
- Allows the browser to do calculations and change things that we are seeing on the page. **Makes things move**
- Fast

We need to **edit an image**.  That's **calculating** so we need to use javascript.  

## Caman
- Makes it easier to edit images

It makes things **much** easier if we can use Caman to make common edits to images.
