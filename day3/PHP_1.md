#PHP: "Hello World"

##What is PHP?##

**Read a definition ([here](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp))**

**PHP can appear anywhere within an HTML file**

You will sometimes see it above <!DOCTYPE html>, or inside or around any HTML container below that. 

**Try it out: Create a new page and add the following code:**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<title>My First PHP page</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
  <?php  
      
  ?>  
</body>  
</html>  
```

Notice the **&lt;?php** and **?&gt;** brackets.

- **&lt;?php** will *start* a section of PHP code
- **?&gt;** will *end* a section of PHP code

Now **save** the file.  It can be anything but it needs to *end with* **.php**.

##Inside the &lt;?php ?&gt; section....

Type:

```php
    echo "Hello World";
```

Save it & upload it, see what happens
