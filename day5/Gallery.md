#Gallery

**Create your gallery page.**

Create a new .php file and name it gallery.php. Start it off as another basic web page by either typing the code below or copying and pasting the code from yesterday's **select.php** file - but delete everything inside ````<body>... </body>````. It should look like this:

````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Gallery</title>

<script>
</script>
</head>
<body>


</body>
</html>
````
